### Cloud Models 

#### Private Cloud

<dl>
   <dd><u>The private cloud is a cloud environment solely for one organization.<u> Private Clouds provide a high level of security and privacy. It gives organizations more control, but there are trade-offs. Having your own private cloud computing environment comes at a higher cost & it does not reap the benefits of the public cloud.</dd>
</dl>

#### Public Cloud 

<dl>
   <dd>Public cloud is built, managed, and controlled by a third-party provide. The three key cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Microsoft owns Azure, Amazon owns Amazon Web Services, and Google owns Good Cloud Platform. This main seem obvious by the title, but <u>public cloud is available to anyone<u></dd>
